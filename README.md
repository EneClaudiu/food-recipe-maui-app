# Food recipes app using .NET MAUI and ASP.NET Core
**Recipe Cabinet** is a cross-platform mobile application developed using .NET MAUI, designed to help users discover, save, manage, and share culinary recipes. It also provides nutritional information and allows users to rate their favorite recipes. The backend is powered by ASP .NET Core Web API and PostgreSQL.

**Note**: This application was developed as part of my Bachelor's degree project at Transilvania University of BraÈ™ov.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/EneClaudiu/food-recipes-maui-app.git
   ```
2. **Setup the database**:
   
   Create a PostgreSQL database with the three tables corresponding to the `Recipe`, `User` and `RecipeRatings` models from `RecipeCabinetAPI`.
3. **Configure AWS S3**:
   
   Create a bucket for storing images and an IAM User.
   
4. **Create Edamam API account**:
   
   Create an [Edamam Nutrition Analysis API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-nutrition-api) account.
5. **Setup the API settings**:

   In the `RecipeCabinetAPI/appsettings.json`, configure the Database and AWS.
   
   Also, choose a JWT key.
6. **Configure the MAUI project**:
   
   In `RecipeCabinet/MauiProgram.cs` replace the API Uri with yours and in `RecipeCabinet/Services/EdamamService.cs` enter the app credentials from your Edamam account.

7. **Run the project**:

   Run the API first, then the MAUI app.

   `Note: Depending on the system configurations, the first API call may take longer than expected.`
